WP Local Docker is an easy to use Docker based local development environment for WordPress development that works on Mac, Windows, and Linux. [Reference](https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress)

## Requirements
WP Docker requires  [docker](https://www.docker.com/),  [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/),  [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), and npm. It is recommended that you use the latest versions of docker and docker-compose. Node 12 is the minimum version of node that is currently supported. We recommend using  [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)  to manage Node versions.
